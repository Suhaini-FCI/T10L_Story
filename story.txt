Adam wakes up in the morning.
He brushes his teeth.
He has breakfast.
Then he grabs his backpack filled with guns and ammos.
He went outside and were just in time for the bus to school.
His heart beats not from nervousness, but from excitement.
Today is the day.
The bus drops off the students, Adam walks to class.
He hasn't decided to do what he yearned for yet, he is simply waiting for the last straw.
